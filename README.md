Advent Of Code .netcore 2.1 Implementations

This is a fun little project to keep that coding brain stimulated. Advent of Code is a day by day code challenge to be approached by any programing method. I have opted to build a quick console app in .netcore 2.1 which loads my mini programs with reflection.

The tasks are provided by the brilliant mind of Eric Wastl over at AdventOfCode.
